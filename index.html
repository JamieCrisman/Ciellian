        <h2>
          //about
        </h2>

        <p>This project is just a little constructed language I started. Some of the core concepts I wanted to emphasize is the concept of abstract and real. In particular a way of communicating abstract concepts in mathematics and computer science. Until I have a name for it, the language will be noted as MBL (Mind Body Lang).</p>

        <h2>
          //alphabet
        </h2>

        <p>I have studied Japanese on and off for the last few years. While the language has less sounds than English, I think their consistency (with few exceptions) makes it for a much more understandable language. The character '<em>a</em>' makes the '<em>a</em>' sound in almost all cases. Because of this simplicity the MBL alphabet is very much based on a similar structure of syllable letters.</p>

        <h3>Real and Non-Real</h3>
        <p>
          There are three syllable types in MBL: <em>Null, Abstract, and Real</em>. The set of real syllables is typically used to define physical objects, and the set of abstract syllables is for defining abstract concepts or non-physical things. They are not strictly restricted to that rule. Null syllables may be found in either real or abstract words.
        </p>
        <h3>Bridging</h3>
        <p>
          The real syllable <em>chi</em>, abstract syllable <em>si</em>, and null syllable <em>shi</em> are the connecting syllables. These are typically seen when connecting real and non-real ideas.
        </p>

        <h3> 
          -Null
        </h3>

        <p>The syllables: <em>a, i, u, e, o, and shi</em> are a shared set of syllables not between the abstract and real classifications. Every other syllable has two or three characters.</p>

        <h3>Syllable Pattern</h3>
        There's a general syllable pattern you may see within MBL where a gradient of meaning occurs. For example, the <em>a</em> syllables will typically mean positive, true, bright, hot, etc. Where the <em>o</em> syllables will typically give a negative, false, dark, and cold type of meanings.
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <th>true</th>
            <th>less true</th>
            <th>neutral</th>
            <th>less false</th>
            <th>false</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>a</td>
              <td>i</td>
              <td>u</td>
              <td>e</td>
              <td>o</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          <em>a</em> by itself does not necessarily mean true, but it implies a true meaning. Even in other syllables such as <em>ka, pa, and na</em>. Note that <em> shi, si, and chi</em> are not on this gradient. Those syllables would imply unknown or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat">Schr√∂dinger's cat</a>.
